Yell Gelf - Graylog2 Adapter for Your Extensible Logging Library

If you are not yet familiar with **Yell - Your Extensible Logging Library** 
check out the githup project under https://github.com/rudionrails/yell or jump 
directly into the Yell wiki at https://github.com/rudionrails/yell/wiki.

Just in case you wonder: GELF means Graylog Extended Log Format. Read all 
it at http://www.graylog2.org/about/gelf.

## Installation

System wide:

```console
gem install yell-gelf
```

Or in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "yell-gelf"
```

## Usage

After you set-up Graylog2 accordingly, you may use the Gelf adapter just like 
any other.

```ruby
logger = Yell.new :gelf

logger.info "Hello World"
# Check your Graylog2 web server for the received message.
```

Or alternatively with the block syntax:

```ruby
logger = Yell.new do
  adapter :gelf
end

logger.info 'Hello World!'
```

If you are running Graylog2 on a different server or port, you can pass those 
options to the adapter:

```ruby
logger = Yell.new :gelf, :host => 'hostname', :port => 1234

# Or with the block syntax
logger = Yell.new do
  adapter :gelf, :host => 'hostname', :port => 1234
end

logger.info 'Hello World!'
```
